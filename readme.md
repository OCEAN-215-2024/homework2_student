# OCEAN 215 Homework 2
This repository contains your starter code for Homework 2. In this assignment, Autograder check cells are _not_ embedded within the notebook. To check whether you have passed the Autograder tests, upload your completed notebook to Gradescope and to run the Autograder. Make sure your code fully runs by restarting the kernel and running every cell before submitting to Gradescope!


**Due Friday Oct. 25th @ 11:59 pm**

**Regrade Request Due Date: Friday Nov. 8th @ 11:59 pm**

**Objective:** This assignment will give you experience with control flow, Numpy arrays and functions, datetimes, and basic plotting.

## Accessing your code
There are several ways to begin working on your code.

1. Click on the `HW2.ipynb` file and download the raw file. Upload the file into JupyterHub to start working.

2. Connect via SSH ID to GitHub and clone the repository. We will go over how to do this in Week 5, so don't worry if you don't know how to do this yet.


## Submitting your assignment to Gradescope
You can either submit your code by:

1. Downloading your finished notebook and uploading it to Gradescope. Don't forget to press the final submit button to run the Autograder! 

2. Create a new **private** repository in GitHub and connect your GitHub account to Gradescope. Select the GitHub repository with your finished homework code to submit to Gradescope.
